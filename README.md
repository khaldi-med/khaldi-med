### Hi!
#### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm a dedicated self-taught programmer driven by my love for **Linux** and **web development**.
Over time, I've honed my expertise in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, C,**...
However, my thirst for knowledge knows no bounds.

**Join me** as we navigate the ever-evolving software development landscape together, supporting one another.
