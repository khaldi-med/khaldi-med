### Hello Hello!
#### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm a dedicated self-taught programmer driven by my love for **Linux** and **back-end** technologies. 
Over time, I've honed my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, C, SQL..., and more technologies.
However, my thirst for knowledge knows no bounds, and currently, I'm eager to delve into **Go**, **Rust**, and **Vue.js**.

Join me as we traverse the exciting software development landscape, building innovative solutions and shaping the future together.
